Unclutter is a program which runs permanently in the background of an X11
session.  It checks on the X11 pointer (cursor) position every few
seconds, and when it finds it has not moved (and no buttons
are pressed on the mouse, and the cursor is not in the root window)
it creates a small sub-window as a child of the window the cursor is in.
The new window installs a cursor of size 1x1 but a mask of
all 0, ie an invisible cursor.  This allows you to see all the text in
an xterm or xedit, for example.  The human factors crowd would agree it
should make things less distracting.

Once created, the program waits for the pointer to leave the window
and then destroys it, restoring the original situation.
Button events are passed transparently through to the parent window.
They will usually cause the cursor to reappear because an active grab
will be made by the program while the button is down, so the pointer
will apparently leave the window, even though its x y position doesnt change.

The first version of this program used a grab to remove the cursor.
This method is still available with a "-grab" option to the program.

finding and fixing the bug where server button grabs render unclutter
mute, Charles Hannum <mycroft@ai.mit.edu> and to all those who tested
various development versions sent by mail.

The program is released into the public domain.  Only the considerate
